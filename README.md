## Overview

**RBXASSET CREATOR** is a tool for Roblox Studio so you can test stuff before uploading it. I donâ€™t like having to drag stuff into the content folder, so I find it easier to use this. Honestly, I was pretty bored and needed something to make.

## What It Does

- Takes an input file
- Randomizes the name
- Puts it inside of the content folder
- Copies the RBXASSET to your clipboard
